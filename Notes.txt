1 Incorrectly added initial data to git repository. And so I can't look for the changes that I made.

At first I had to add the initial project and commit it with initial commit.
At second - write method that remove item from localStorage and make commit (added method to model (remove item)).
Next - write method that remove item from view and make commit (added method to view (remove item)).
Then I had to push  data to the git repository.
